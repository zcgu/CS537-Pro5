- Set O_CHECKED to 0x400 in fcntl.h.
- Set T_CHECKED to 4 in stat.h.
- Add checksum to stat struct in stat.h.
- In fs.c, modify stati() to return the checksum of the file.
  The checksum is equal to XOR of checksum value in all of the blocks.
  If the file uses indirectory, we should also calculate all of the indirect blocks.
- In fs.c, add getchecksum() to get the checksum of a block.
- In fs.c, add setchecksum() to set the checksum of a block.
- In fs.c, modify readi() to check the type.
  If this is a checked file, the address need change after bmap().
  Also, when reading a block, check whether the checksum of data match the exists checksum.
- In fs.c, modify writei() to check the type and change the address.
  Set the checksum after write blocks.
- Write filestat to print type, size and checksum of a checked file.
  If input is not a checked file, print error info.
